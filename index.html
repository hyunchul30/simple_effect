<p>“[Koreans] are very protective of their culture and their race—they want to protect whatever they have,”<br>French photographer Tim Franco, who travelled to the islands this summer, tells National Geographic.<br>“Dokdo is a good example of that. This is one thing that they
  kept back from World War II and it's very important to them to keep it.”<br>
